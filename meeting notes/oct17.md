### Questions
 - Handling multiple files/folders, should the front end take care of the queue and send it to back end one at a time or should front end send a group of files and back end returns a group as well? **this is now a stretch goal, probably back end**
 - What do we need to divide the work for the image processing? **Robert will work on making talking points for Thursday**
 - What exactly is entailed in 'Base backend logic for uploading an image' card?
    - We need 1) image storage 2) respond to front end with path to image **looks good**
