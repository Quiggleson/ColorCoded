    <p>
      Color blindness as the name suggests is when someone does not perceive the
      world in the same vibrant colorful way as most of the world. This ailment
      can be more than just a lack of beauty in the world in some circumstances.
      The internet is an ever expanding world full of colorful websites and
      images that if not handled properly could be miss-represented to this
      portion of our communities. Our project aims to help everyone designing
      things on the internet create in a way that is accessible to as many
      people as possible, despite the way they see the world. Below is a brief
      discription of each type with an example of how a person with each type of
      color blindness sees.

    <h2>Types of Color blindness</h2>

      person cannot perceive green light as well as others.

      Tritanopia is an extremely rare form of color blindness which as you may
      be able to guess at this point is the name for people who cannot perceive
      blue light as well as others.
